                    <h2>Gear Service £25</h2><br> Our Gear Service is a full strip down and rebuild of the drivetrain of your bicycle. Our mechanics will clean, check and lubricate all the parts and recommend any replacement parts required. The aim is to
                    ensure that your bicycle is returned to you with the drivetrain looking and operating as close to brand new as possible. The Gear Service includes all of the following:<br><br>

                    that your bike runs smoothly for longer. The staff in our stores will be able to advise you in detail, but in general we would recommend you choose a Gear Service:<br><br>

                    <h2>Brake Service £20</h2><br> Maintaining your brakes is one of the most important things you can do for your bike. Our Brake Service is specifically targeted at ensuring that your brakes work reliably when you need them. Whether you
                    have V-brakes, cable disc brakes or a hydraulic system our mechanics will inspect, clean, service and adjust your brakes to optimise performance. The Brake Service includes all of the following:<br><br>
                    <span style="line-height: 1.5">

                    think that getting your brakes checked regularly is really important to keep your bike safe. The staff in our stores will be able to advise you in detail, but in general we would recommend you choose a Brake Service:<br>
                    <span style="line-height: 1.5">• If your brakes lack stopping power<br>
                        • If your brakes feel spongy, rough or soft<br>

                    <h2>Wheel Service £25</h2><br> In our Wheel Service, our mechanics will give your wheels the attention they need. Keeping your wheels serviced is vital to the smooth running of your bicycle and helps to avoid the minor wheel ailments that
                    build up over riding time. Within the service we will look after the wheels themselves and the internal workings of the hubs to make sure that are returned to factory standard. The Wheel Service includes all of the following:<br><br>
                    <span style="line-height: 1.5">
                        • Full bike inspection and report<br>

                        • Full wheel rebuild £10 per wheel<br>
                        • Tubeless set up for road or MTB £5 per wheel</span><br><br><br> When to choose a Wheel Service?<br><br> As the main contact point with the road or trail, the wheels really take the brunt of the terrain. Be
                    it pot holes, roots or just everyday use, it is common for wheels to lose spoke tension, snap spokes or for hubs to stop spinning smoothly. The staff in the store will be able to advise you in detail, but we would generally recommend
                    you choose a Wheel Service:<br><br>
                    <span style="line-height: 1.5">• If your spokes feel loose, you have some broken spokes or your brakes are rubbing intermittently<br>
                        • If your hubs feel rough or there is play in the wheel itself<br>
                        • After winter to ensure your bike is restored and ready for spring<br>
                        • At least every 12-18 Months</span>
