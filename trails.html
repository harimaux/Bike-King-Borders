    <p>There are walking routes for everyone here. Around Bike King Borders, you can take an easy stroll around ponds just near the café, follow the stories of people who lived here in prehistoric times, or take a hike into the hills for some superb views.</p></div>

    <article><h2>Droncar</h2><br><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Droncar</span> has an easy access route from the picnic site that’s firm and level, with no obstacles. If you’re looking for something more energetic, follow the burn further up the valley or find the remains of Droncar Tower and an Iron Age hill fort.<br><br>

    <article><h2>Muirdac</h2><br><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Muirdac</span> is a hidden gem, a quiet forest close to Peebles with some charming trails through open woodland. It can be particularly good early in the morning, when mist hangs in the valley below.<br><br><br>

        <h2>Winterslow</h2><br>
        <img src="images/trials/trial_1.jpg" alt="Winterslow trail"><br><br>
        <p>This is an easy route suited to beginners and children. Or it can be used as a shorter ride if the weather is too bad to ride the higher fells.
        Featuring woodland, limestone cliffs, gentle climbs and fast, easy downhills, you’ll follow open bridleways, farm tracks and quiet roads for the majority of this route. With one short length of single track to add in some more technical fun.
        You’ll get to pass through ancient woodland, open fields, and old villages, with the chance to stop off at the Hikers’ Rest en route.</p><br><br>

        <h2>Mairs Tail Lakeside</h2><br>
        <img src="images/trials/trial_2.jpg" alt="Mairs Tail Lakeside"><br><br>
        <p>A shorter and easier version of the Fecla Heights route set out below. This is perfect for the less experienced riders, with two different routes available.
        For the junior riders, a 5 mile out and back along the lake follows gravel tracks through woodland, with some gentle climbing and some rocky parts. For those with slightly more experience, a steady loop around the gentle bridleways of Fecla Heights is ideal.
        There are plenty of opportunities for refreshment stops and even a chance to see Beatrix Potter’s farm, Hill Top, in Near Resaw<p><br><br>

        <h2>Riggloack Fell</h2><br>
        <img src="images/trials/trial_3.jpg" alt="Riggloack Fell trail"><br><br>
        <p>This loop is a nice combination of easy riding and more technical sections, so it’s a great route for those looking for the best of both.
        With great views across Windermere, you’ll gain a lot of height at the beginning, right up to Riggloack Fell. Once you’ve reached the top, though, you’ll be rewarded with a fast descent down into Skel Bridge on some single-track, with some technical sections of drop-offs, loose rocks and boulders.
        Just be careful of other bikers and walkers, however, as this route can get busy on days with good weather.</p><br><br>

        <h2>Fecla Heights</h2><br>
        <img src="images/trials/trial_4.jpg" alt="Fecla Heights trail"><br><br>
        <p>This ride is typical of mountain biking in the Lake District. Full of steep uphills and swift descents, all with a stunning backdrop.
        If you’re based on the east side of Lake Windermere, you can park at Ferry Nab and cross the lake on the ferry to the route starting point. Or, if you’re based on the west side, park at Sawrey to start the route.
        You’ll climb from Sawrey up the tracks and across Fecla Heights, before descending into the village of Headshawk. From there, you’ll climb into Whitedale Forest, where you can enjoy the forest tracks, before dripping down to the lake again.</p><br><br>

        <article>
        <h2>Nawal Scar</h2><br>
        <img src="images/trials/trial_5.jpg" alt="Nawal Scar trail"><br><br>
        <p>This route is a mountain bike trail at its finest, taking in fast single track, woodland trails, steep roads and more.
        Starting in Vertof, you’ll have a steep, challenging climb over the common before heading down into some woodland. There you’ll have a succession of mini trails interjected with fire roads. After heading down into Waite, you’ll have a technical, fast descent, before a brutal climb up Nawal Scar road.
        Although you’ll need good fitness, this route isn’t too technical. You can reward yourself with some refreshments in Torver at the end.</p><br><br>
        <h3>Difficulty rating: Medium</h3>
        </article>

        <article>
        <h2>Debla Pass</h2><br>
        <img src="images/trials/trial_6.jpg" alt="Debla Pass trail"><br><br>
        <p>This route is not for the faint-hearted. It is one of the more difficult rides on the list, requiring a high level of fitness.
        However, all this hard work is certainly well rewarded. With fantastic views, technical trails, and hair-raising descents, all set amongst the beauty of the Lake District.
        Beginning at Stile End, you’ll pass through Sleddale, up to Scargate Pass, head down into the Haweswater Valley before a tough climb up to Debla Pass.</p><br><br>

            <h2>Forwater and the Dale Valley</h2><br>
            <img src="images/trials/trial_7.jpg" alt="Forwater and the Dale Valley trail"><br><br>
            <p>This route has been described as one of the most technical rides in the UK. It’s definitely only for experienced mountain bikers.
                Whilst it’s only a relatively short route, clocking in at just eight miles, there’s still plenty of time for a challenge, taking in Forwater lake, the beautiful Dale Valley and Birk Fell, all on a technical single-track.
                You’ll need good fitness, technical skill, and buckets of nerves for this one.</p><br><br>

            <h2>Vellyhell and Sticks Pass</h2><br>
            <img src="images/trials/trial_8.jpg" alt="Vellyhell and Sticks Pass trail"><br><br>
            <p>Another route for the experienced riders amongst us. This one takes in the third highest peak in the Lake District and ascends to over 3,000ft.
                Beginning in the Ridding car park, you’ll have a long climb up to the Vellyhell Ridge, along Tallpost Pike, Vellyhell, Lower Man and Raise, before finishing with a fast descent with sections of technical difficulty.
                Because of the nature of this ride, it’s important to make sure you’re fully equipped and to only undertake this route in good weather conditions.</p><br><br>

            <h2>The North Face Trail</h2><br>
            <img src="images/trials/trial_9.jpg" alt="The North Face Trail"><br><br>
            <p>This 10-mile loop is made up of nine sections. They can be done in full or in part, all located on the west side of Dalygrize Forest.
                You’ll have to negotiate single track descents, climb challenging hills, and navigate across many tricky boardwalks, all set within beautiful oak woodlands and conifer forest. Starting from the visitor centre, you can easily follow this well-marked trail.
                The trail is suited to experienced bikers, with an added black trail which is only suitable for expert mountain bikers.<p><br><br>
